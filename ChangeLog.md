## Changes Between 2.4.0 and 2.5.0

### Clojure 1.7 by Default

The project now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.7.0`. It is
still compatible with Clojure 1.5 and if your `project.clj` depends on
a different version, it will be used, but 1.7 is the default now.



## Changes Between 2.3.0 and 2.4.0

### Clojure 1.4 Support Dropped

The project no longer tries to maintain Clojure 1.4 compatibility.

### validate-some

`validate-some` tries any number of validators, short-circuiting at the first failed validator. This behavior is similar to `or`.

```clojure
(require '[validateur.validation :refer :all])

(let [v (validate-some
         (presence-of :cake-count :message "missing_cake")
         (validate-by :cake-count odd? :message "even_cake"))]

  "Odd cake counts are valid."
  (v {:cake-count 1})
  ;;=> [true #{}]


  "Even cake counts only throw the second error, since the first
  validation passed."
  (v {:cake-count 2})
  ;;=> [false {:cake-count #{"even_cake"}}]

  "The second validation never gets called and never throws a NPE, as
  it would if we just composed them up."
  (v {})
  ;;=> [false {:cake-count #{"missing_cake"}}]
  )
```

### errors? and errors

Errors in validateur are vectors if keys are nested. If keys are only
one layer deep - `:cake`, for example - the error can live at `:cake`
or `[:cake]`.

The `errors` function returns the set of errors for some key, nested
or bare. `:cake` will return errors stored under `[:cake]` and
vice-versa.

`errors?` is a boolean wrapper that returns true if some key has
errors, false otherwise.

## Changes Between 2.2.0 and 2.3.0

### unnest

`unnest` is a helper function useful for building UIs that validate on the fly. Here's a basic example. Let's write some code to render a UI off of a nested map and build up live validation for that map off of component validators. Here are the components:

```clojure
(def profile-validator
  (vr/validation-set
   (vr/presence-of #{:first-name :last-name})))

(def secret-validator
  (vr/validation-set
   (vr/length-of :password :within (range 5 15))
   (vr/length-of :phone :is 10)))
```

And then the composed, user account validator:

```clojure
(def account-validator
  (vr/compose-sets
   (vr/nested :secrets secret-validator)
   (vr/nested :profile profile-validator)))
```

Next are the "rendering" functions. Imagine that these are input components responsible for validating their input and displaying errors when present. Our "render" phase will just print.

```clojure
(defn render-profile [profile errors]
  (prn "Profile: " profile)
  (prn "Profile Errors: " errors))

(defn render-secrets [secrets errors]
  (prn "Secrets: " secrets)
  (prn "Secret Errors: " errors))

(defn submit-button
  "Renders a submit button that can only submit when no errors are
  present."
  [errors]
  (prn "All Errors: " errors))
```

The `render-account` function renders all subcomponents, performs global validation and routes the errors and data where each needs to go:

```clojure
(defn render-account
  "This function accepts an account object, validates the entire thing
  using the subvalidators defined above, then uses `unnested` to pull
  out specific errors for each component.

  The entire validation error map is passed into `submit-button`,
  which might only allow a server POST on click of the full error map
  is empty."
  [{:keys [secrets profile] :as account}]
  (let [errors (account-validator account)]
    (render-profile profile (vr/unnest :profile errors))
    (render-secrets secrets (vr/unnest :secrets errors))
    (submit-button errors)))
```

Let's see this function in action. Calling `render-account` with an invalid map triggers a render that shows off a bunch of errors:

```clojure
(render-account
   {:secrets {:password "face"
              :phone "703555555512323"}
    :profile {:first-name "Queequeg"}})


"Profile: " {:first-name "Queequeg"}
"Errors: " {[:last-name] #{"can't be blank"}}
"Secrets: " {:password "face", :phone "703555555512323"}
"Errors: " {[:phone] #{"must be 10 characters long"}, [:password] #{"must be from 5 to 14 characters long"}}
"All Errors: " {[:profile :last-name] #{"can't be blank"}, [:secrets :phone] #{"must be 10 characters long"}, [:secrets :password] #{"must be from 5 to 14 characters long"}}
```

Calling `render-account` with a valid map prints only the data:

```clojure
(render-account
 {:secrets {:password "faceknuckle"
            :phone "7035555555"}
  :profile {:first-name "Queequeg"
            :last-name "Kokovoko"}})

"Profile: " {:last-name "Kokovoko", :first-name "Queequeg"}
"Errors: " {}
"Secrets: " {:password "faceknuckle", :phone "7035555555"}
"Errors: " {}
"All Errors: " {}
```

### nest

`nest` is a helper function that makes it easy to validate dynamic data that's not part of the actual map you pass into the validator. For example, say you wanted to validate all user accounts, then build up a map of userid -> validation errors:

```clojure
(for [account (get-all-accounts)]
  (vr/nest (:id account)
           (account-validator account)))

{[100 :profile :first-name] "can't be blank"
 [200 :profile :last-name] "can't be blank"
 ;; etc
 }
```

## Changes Between 2.1.0 and 2.2.0

### nested

`nested` is a new validator runner for nested attributes.

``` clojure
(require '[validateur.validation :as :vr])

(let [v (vr/nested :user (vr/validation-set
                            (vr/presence-of :name)
                            (vr/presence-of :age)))
        extra-nested (vr/nested [:user :profile]
                                (vr/validation-set
                                 (vr/presence-of :age)
                                 (vr/presence-of [:birthday :year])))]
  (v {})
  ;= {[:user :age] #{"can't be blank"}
      [:user :name] #{"can't be blank"}}
  (v {:user {:name "name"}})
  ;= {[:user :age] #{"can't be blank"}}
  (extra-nested {:user {:profile {:age 10
                                  :birthday {:year 2004}}}})
  ;= {}
  (extra-nested {:user {:profile {:age 10}}})
  ;= {[:user :profile :birthday :year] #{"can't be blank"}}
```

### validate-by

`validate-by` is a new validator function. It returns a function that,
when given a map, will validate that the + value of the attribute in
that map is one of the given:

``` clojure
(require '[validateur.validation :refer :all])

(validation-set
   (presence-of :name)
   (presence-of :age)
   (validate-by [:user :name] not-empty :message \"Username can't be empty!\"))
```

## Changes Between 2.0.0 and 2.1.0

### Multi-field Support For Presence Validator

`presence-of` validator now supports validation over
multiple (all or any) fields:

``` clojure
;; both fields must be non-nil
(vr/presence-of #{:name :msg})

;; either field must be non-nil
(vr/presence-of #{:name :msg} :any true)
```

### Better ClojureScript Support

Validateur no longer uses crossovers which are
deprecated in `lein-cljsbuild`.

## Changes Between 1.7.0 and 2.0.0

### Clojure 1.6

Validateur now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.6.0`. It is
still compatible with Clojure 1.4 and if your `project.clj` depends on
a different version, it will be used, but 1.6 is the default now.


### Validator Predicates (Guards)

It is now possible to wrap a validator into a function
that will check a condition before applying the validator.

To do so, use `validate-when`:

``` clojure
(require '[validateur.validation])

(defn new?
  [user]
  (nil? (:id user)))

(defn unique-email?
  [user]
  (if-let [existing (find-by-email (:email user)]
    (= (:id user) (:id existing))
    true))

(def validate
  (validation-set
    (presence-of :email)
    (validate :email unique-email? :message "is already taken")
    (validate-when new? (presence-of :password))
    (validate-when #(contains? % :password) (presence-of :password))))
```

If provided predicate returns `false`, the validator it guards is not
executed.

### Generic Validator

Generic validator uses a predicate function and attaches errors to specified
attribute:

``` clojure
(require '[validateur.validation])

(validate-with-predicate :id unique? :message "ID is not unique")
```

### ClojureWerkz Support Dependency Dropped

ClojureWerkz Support is no longer a dependency of Validateur.
This makes it easier to use Validateur in ClojureScript projects.

Contributed by hura.

### Validation Set Composition

Validateur now supports composition of validation sets. To
compose several sets, use `validateur.validation/compose-sets`:

``` clojure
(let [vn (vr/validation-set
           (vr/presence-of :name))
      va (vr/validation-set
           (vr/presence-of :age))
      v  (vr/compose-sets va vn)]
  ;= true
  (vr/valid? v { :name "Joe" :age 28 }))
```

### ClojureScript Support

Validateur now supports ClojureScript.

## Changes between Validateur 1.5.0 and 1.6.0

### Corrected logic in blank/nil validations

Corrected the logic in the allowed-to-be-blank functions to properly allow nil values
when allow-nil is true, but allow-blank is false. Previously, both allow-blank and allow-nil
had to be set to true to allow nil values due to clojure's blank? function returning true for nil.

Contributed by Wes Johnson.

### Clojure 1.3 No Longer Supported

Clojure 1.3 is no longer supported by Validateur.



## Changes between Validateur 1.4.0 and 1.5.0

### Optional messages in built-in validators

All built-in validators but length-of accept optional messages for all
cases. Their formatting is fixed and based in default ones.
For example:

``` clojure
((inclusion-of :genre :in #{"trance", "dnb"} :message "debe pertenecer a:")
 {:genre "pasodoble"})
;; [false {:genre #{"debe pertenecer a: trance, dnb"}}]
```

### Optional function callback to parametrize the construction of messages

All built-in validators accept an optional function callback which
will be called by the validator to build the returned error message.
The main goal is to facilitate the inclusion of i18n in messages (like
previous one but in a more flexible way).
For example:

``` clojure
((inclusion-of :genre :in #{"trance", "dnb"}
               :message-fn (fn [validator map prop & args]
                              [validator map prop args]))
 {:genre "pasodoble"})
;; [false {:genre #{[:inclusion {:genre "pasodoble"} :genre (#{"trance" "dnb"})]}}]
```


## Changes between Validateur 1.3.0 and 1.4.0

### Clojure 1.5.1 By Default

Validateur now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.5.1` which
includes an important bug fix.

## Changes between Validateur 1.2.0 and 1.3.0

### clojurewerkz.support 0.14.0

[ClojureWerkz Support](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/support) upgraded to `v0.14.0`.

### Clojure 1.5

Validateur now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.5.0`. It is
still compatible with Clojure 1.3 and if your `project.clj` depends on
a different version, it will be used, but 1.5 is the default now.

We encourage all users to upgrade to 1.5, it is a drop-in replacement
for the majority of projects out there.


## Changes between Validateur 1.1.0 and 1.2.0

### Doc strings

Built-in validation functions now have doc strings.

### clojurewerkz.support 0.6.0

[ClojureWerkz Support](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/support) upgraded to `v0.6.0`.


## Changes between Validateur 1.0.0 and 1.1.0

### Nested attributes support

`presence-of` and other DSL functions now support nested attributes (think `clojure.core/get-in`),
for example:

``` clojure
(validation-set
  (presence-of :email)
  (presence-of [:address :street])
  (presence-of [:card :cvc]))
```


### clojurewerkz.support dependency

Validateur now depends on [ClojureWerkz Support](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/support).


### Leiningen 2

Validateur now uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading).
